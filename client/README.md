# Palamander Zoo Client

Chrome Extension for the Palamander Zoo. Composed with [React](https://react.dev/) ([TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)) and built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

Currently contains the boilerplate configuration and placeholder code from `npm create vite@latest`, run to target React w/ TypeScript. Some extra assets/styling/components have been removed to leave a minimal working app to start from.
